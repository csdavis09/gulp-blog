I am learning to code. Come join me on this crazy endeavor.

I am not a computer scientist. I did not start out with a degree in tech.  After college, I worked in pharmaceutical sales, and worked my up into specialty pharma.  I eventually left corporate America to be a stay at home mom and try to really figure out what I wanted to do next.

Like many others, I didn't go out searching for a career in web development, I stumbled into it.  I read an article about the future of women in tech, and thought I would look into it. What I found, I loved.

So, for any of you out there looking to learn how to code, I hope you can use my journey as a resource to decide whether or not web development is right for you.  Tune in, as next week I talk about how it felt starting out.
