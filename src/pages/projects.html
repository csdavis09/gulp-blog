<h2>The Design Process</h2>
<p>The design process starts with a meeting between you and I, and coffee...
because, well, I like coffe.</p>

<p>After discussing your goals, possible design ideas and timelines, I will
map out a plan and a bid.  Once contracts are signed, we can move onto the
design phase.</p>

<p>During the design process, I will provide you with a markup of what to 
expect in your webpage.  Consider this the prototype of your website.</p>

<p>Next comes the development phase.  In this phase, your website will come alive.  I will build out all of the backend and frontend structure of your site.  During this phase, we will fine tune the site for final deployment.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have come to D-Day - Deployment day.  This is when we take your site live, and officially make it accessible on the world wide web. That's it, that's the process from zero to a fully-functioning site.</p>

<p>Once your site is up and running, should you need additional help with your site, we can discuss optional web mastering services for an additional fee.</p>
