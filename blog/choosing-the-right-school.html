What is important to you? What are your learning styles? How will you best balance school with home?</p><!--more--><p>There are a plethora of online and in-person bootcamp options. However, choosing the right school can be daunting. One of the things that was most frustrating for me was finding accurate representations of what the school was like. Inevetiably the reviews available were of only the students that successfully completed the program. Yet, when I would ask recruiting officers what percentage of their admitted students completed the program, sometimes the numbers of drop-outs were astounding.</p><p>Yet, these were supposed to be cream of the crop, the best and most reputable programs. One such program had a drop out rate of 56% for the previous year of students. When you are thinking about spending several thousands of dollars for a program, which inevitably has a partial refund policy, it would be......blah, blah, blah.</p></div></div></div></div><footer><ul class="list list-inline text-center"><li><img src="/img/LinkedIn.png" alt="linkdin"></li><li><img src="/img/Twitter.png" alt="twitter"></li><li><img src="/img/Instagram.png" alt="instagram"></li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-0mSbJDEHialfmuBBQP6A4Qrprq5OVfW37PRR3j5ELqxss1yVqOtnepnHVP9aJ7xS" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></body></html>
