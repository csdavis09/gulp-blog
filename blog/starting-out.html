I just knew what I didn&#39;t want. I didn&#39;t want to start learning at an online school that was going to give me baby steps, but not give me access to answers as to what each of the steps meant. I knew starting out, that I wanted to be able to have real, and accessible conversations with my mentors throughout my learning process - not 30 minute blocks of time schedule according to their schedule, not when I needed them.</p><!--more--><p>My first day at Devschool consisted of an onboarding meeting. Jim and I met over webconference, and he helped setup my development environment on my laptop. He explained that I would be learning to use Vim, a text editor located in the terminal. Unlike other text editors, Vim allows me to work in any terminal, no matter where it is located. This is important when working on others code, or working remotely where I may have to be dialed into another terminal.</p><p>Jim, also explained that with using Vim, I would be able to quickly move between the terminal and my editor, allowing me to type and run code quickly and effortlessly without toggleing back and forth between applications.</p><p>Next, we went over the flow of the classes. I would have hour long mentoring sessions twice a week. Starting out, there would be more paired programming, to help me along my learning path. The mentoring sessions are immersive, meaning I would be learning according to how a programmer problems solves each week. The mentoring schedules could be adjusted to what worked best within my schedule, but should typically be kept consistently. Next, there would be group lessons 4-6 days a week, in which my classmates and I would join a group session to watch how to code a particular problem. One session, we might be coding out a game of dominoes, the next session we may be coding a deck of cards.</p></div></div></div></div><footer><ul class="list list-inline text-center"><li><img src="/img/LinkedIn.png" alt="linkdin"></li><li><img src="/img/Twitter.png" alt="twitter"></li><li><img src="/img/Instagram.png" alt="instagram"></li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-0mSbJDEHialfmuBBQP6A4Qrprq5OVfW37PRR3j5ELqxss1yVqOtnepnHVP9aJ7xS" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></body></html>
